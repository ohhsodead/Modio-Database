# Arisen Studio Database
This repo contains all the data for the game mods, homebrew, resources, plugins, apps, and game saves used in the [Arisen Studio](https://github.com/ohhsodead/arisen-studio) project.

All files are hosted on my personal Dropbox. If you would like something added to the database, fill out [this form](https://arisen.studio/submit) on my website, otherwise [open an issue](https://github.com/ohhsodead/arisen-studio-database/issues/new?assignees=&labels=mod_request&projects=&template=mod_request.yml&title=%5BRequest%5D%3A+).

## Creators
If you are the owner of anything and you would like it removed then please [open an issue](https://github.com/ohhsodead/arisen-studio-database/issues/new) to let me know.

## Bugs
If you find any issues with the mods then you should contact the creator as I can't do anything about it.
