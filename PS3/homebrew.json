(Note that MORE safe doesn't mean IT IS safe !). It also deletes the boot history execution.\n\nThe optional cobra plugins unloads from memory after activation.\n\nHow to Use (Summary by kozarovv)\nGeneral rule is to install psn patch ----> run ----> go to toolbox (select) ----> install psnpatch plugin. After that restart your PS3. Ir's one time process, now your psn access should be locked until you use L3+R3+R2 from the XMB.\n\nSo generally you need to mount game, use combo, run game. That's all, but remember that if you want to change game or run ANY homebrew. You need to first restart your ps3 to lock psn access, and remember there is no 100% that you will don't get ban.\n\n\nA new homebrew blocker is included in the psnpatch plugin - in the plugin only.\nIt is enabled by default.\nIf you don't want to use it, go into psnpatch xmb application, toolbox menu, and disable it there.\nThe homebrew blocker blocks home brew excution when CEX/DEX Syscalls are disabled.\nExecution will be locked until the next reboot.\nThe homebrew blocker runs in cobra, near-cobra (mamba) and non-cobra systems.\nThis implementation is compatible with eventually future cobra updates for core homebrew blockers.\n\nThe approach used is detailed in the homebrew_blocker module source code included in this pasnpatch distribution\n\nIt was heavily tested, namely simulating crashes, forced reboots, recovery menu accesses, file system recovery and database rebuilds. Up to know is failsafe proof, but as usual there is no warranty ;)\n\nDownload PSN Patch 2017.02/B: www.sendspace.com/file/8wbzhf\n\nOFFICIAL SUPPORT FORUM psx-place.com",

The package is actually 18MB in size too funnily enough. :)\n\nIt uses some dark quantum power that has been hidden from us for centuries by hard drive companies, to actually add free space instead of taking it away. If there is any interest, I might consider releasing a 1TB free space adjuster package for dev_hdd0 :-p\n\nThis uses a little trick, when Minus_18MB installs you will gain 18MB of free space on flash, and you will find a new package in dev_hdd0/packages/ called 'Plus_18MB.pkg' , Install that and you will lose your free space again. More magic.\n\nNOTE 1: This is not an 'installer' application, this pkg installs the free space directly in one step from package manager to dev_blind. Due to that, this package file needs dev_blind to be enabled before install or it can not adjust the free space, you have been warned. :)\n\nThanks to @aldostools and @lmn7 for their work on force_install_to packages.\n\nNOTE 2: This is only tested on the latest Rebug (4.84.2 REX) but it should work fine on other recent CEX/DEX, just 2 whats new icons will turn red if not on Rebug. When restoring using the Plus_18MB.pkg it actually restores the 4.84 REX hknw_plugin.sprx, so if you are not on Rebug 4.84 REX, you can restore by installing CEX/DEX again. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!",
